            <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p>The party met in an underground fighting ring ran By Corwill, where they fought alchemically altered beasts provided by Distilled Dynamics. 
                After the fight they were kidnapped by Distilled dynamics, but succesfully escaped. They then follewed a lead to Drusall, where a shipment 
                of the substance that mutated the beast was being sent.</p>
            
            <p>In Drusall, they investigated Queen Devere and found out it was her who ordered the substance. However, she offered them a lucrative deal to go 
                after Distilled Dynamics, but leave her alone. The party accepted. She told the party that the substance's main ingredient came from Ascana, and
                the only way to get there is through the Gate in Alisport</p>

            <p id="npcs">The party arived in Alisport, and found out that the gate was not yet open for public travel. However, they spoke with the head of research, 
                Doctor Fallo, and he agreed to let them use it in exchange for rescuing a grad student from hell.</p>
