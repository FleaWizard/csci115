            <h2>Barbarian Primal Paths</h2>

            <p id="spellbreaker">When you select your Primal Path at 3rd level, these options are also available to you</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Path of the Spellbreaker</h3>

            <p>Barbarians of this path have a rage so primal it can be wielded against even magic.</p>

            <h5>Spellbreaker’s Fury</h5>
            
            <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, the use of spells against you brings about your fury. 
                Whenever you are subject to an attack roll or saving throw of a spell cast by someone you can see, you 
                gain advantage on your next attack roll against them.</p>

            <h5>Strength of Body</h5>

            <p>Also at 3rd level, you also gain the ability to use the strength of your body to shrug off magical effects. 
                When you are subjected to a saving throw against a spell, you can choose to roll a Strength saving throw 
                instead of the saving throw called for by the spell. This only applies to the saving throw you activate the 
                ability for, and all other effects based on passing or failing the check function as normal. You have one 
                use of this ability, and you gain one addition use at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. You recover all expended uses 
                of this ability on a short or long rest. At your DM’s discretion, you may allow you to use this on magical 
                abilities that are not spells</p>

            <h5>Spellfoil</h5>

            <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to wrench the magic directly from your enemies fingertips. As a reaction you can 
                cast Counterspell at 3rd level, using Strength as your spellcasting ability score. You have two uses of this ability. 
                At 10th level, you gain a 3rd use of this ability, and you now cast Counterspell at 4th level. At 14th level you gain 
                a 4th use of this ability, and you now cast Counterspell at 5th level. You can cast counterspell in this way even when 
                Raging. You regain all uses of this ability on a short or long rest.</p>

            <h5>Magical Defiance</h5>

            <p>At 10th level, you stand unaffected by enemy spells. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a 
                Strength saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and 
                only half damage if you fail.</p>

            <h5>Spell Raider</h5>

            <p id="paladin">At 14th level, you can steal the magic from an opponent. When you hit an opponent with a critical hit, you can choose 
                one magical effect on the opponent and end it, as if you had succeeded on Dispel Magic. In addition, you gain the 
                benefits of this ability until the duration would have ended or your rage ends, whichever happens first.</p>



            <h2>Paladin Oaths</h2>

            <p id="magister">When you select your Oath at 3rd level, these options are also available to you</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Oath of the Magister</h3>

            <p>These Paladins fight agains rogue priests and heretical arcanists.</p>

            <h5>Oath Spells</h5>

            <p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed</p>

            <table class="subTable">
                <tr>
                    <th>Paladin Level</th>
                    <th>Spells</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3rd</td>
                    <td>Detect Magic, Identify</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5th</td>
                    <td>See Invisibility, Silence</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>9th</td>
                    <td>Dispel Magic, Counterspell</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>13th</td>
                    <td>Private Sanctum, Resilient Sphere</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>17th</td>
                    <td>Disintegrate, Arcane Hand</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h5>Channel Divinity</h5>
            
            <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity option.</p>

            <div class="subOption">
                <h6>Surge of Defiance</h6>

                <p>As a reaction, when you or an ally within 30ft would fail a saving throw against a spell, you can use a 
                    Channel Divinity to allow the target to reroll the saving throw. </p>
            </div>

            <h5>Aura of Magical Suppression</h5>

            <p>Starting at 7th level, magical heretics fumble their spells in your presence. You have an aura that extends 10 feet 
                from you, but not through total cover. Whenever an enemy within your aura makes a concentration check, they do so 
                with disadvantage.
                <br>
                At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>


            <h5>Font of Antimagic</h5>

            <p> At 20th level, as an action, you become a bastion against magic for one minute. For the duration, you have advantage on 
                all saving throws against spells. In addition, whenever anyone within 30ft casts a spell, you can choose to make them 
                take 4d6 force damage.</p>
